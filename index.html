        <p>Small business owners have been left behind to navigate the highly volatile world of healthcare
        financing and employee benefits, often unsure of the motivations of brokers, insurers and
        wellness services. The lack of transparency creates a muddy view that owners typically prefer
        to avoid or don’t have the time to strategically address on their own with the intense demands
        of running a successful small business. Business owners can take charge by arming employees
        with the tools to be high performing, confident healthcare consumers.</p>
    
        <p>At Mode Health, we believe that positive health goes beyond the healthcare insurance
        product. We believe that health benefits should be cost-efficient for the long run, not rack up
        unnecessary expenses. We believe that every employee and organization has unique needs,
        and their benefits plans should meet them. We are relentless in the pursuit of a personalized
        experience. Clients are able to tailor plans that fit their specific needs, and consistently adjust
        to the industry’s ebb and flow to remain a market leader.</p>

        <p>Mode Health offers agile employee benefits for the modern small business. Mode Health
        empowers employers to not only create a strategy that works for them, but also supports
        employee health in the process.</p>

    <div class="item"><p>Eric is a catalyst for change. Through a multi-faceted, two-decade healthcare career, he
    developed a unique perspective on personal well-being, as well as healthcare navigation and
    payer systems. This experience inspired Eric to introduce an innovative approach to employee
    benefits through Mode Health–putting employers and employees in charge of their own care.
    <p>Eric believes that employee benefits should be a tool to achieve the optimal employee
    experience. Today, he helps modern, forward-thinking business leaders develop strategies that
    create value and accelerate company performance through a three-step process.</p>
    <p>“The healthcare continuum lacks transparency and has significant pain points,” Eric says. “Most
    of us in the healthcare system are frustrated: healthcare providers with how they’re paid for
    services, employers with how they buy benefits and employees with insurance products that
    don’t fit their unique personal health needs. Yet year after year, employers engage in the same
    painful renewal process. It’s time to demand better and take charge with a strategy that fits our
    own unique mode.”</p></div>

<h2>We’ve been buying health insurance wrong.</h2>
<p>For years, small business owners have tried to work around conventional health plans. Mode
    Health puts you in charge of your benefits plan. For small businesses, independent contractors
    and sole proprietors especially, effective health benefits start with identifying their organization’s
    specific needs, and tailoring a plan around that. (Not the other way around.) With customization
    at the forefront, employers are able to cut costs, recruit and retain employees, see increased
    performance and find a plan that works for them, for a change.</p>
